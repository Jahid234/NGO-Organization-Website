                    <h2>About Our Foundation</h2>
                    <p>NEUB is a national level development organization directly benefitting over 40,000 children and
                        their families every year, through 200 welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women
                        empowerment, in more than 950 remote villages and slums across of Bangladesh</p>
                    <p> Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging country like Bangladesh , development of underprivileged
                        children holds the key to the progress of the nation itself, and their education is the cornerstone of this
                        progress. But education for children cannot be achieved without ensuring the welfare of the family â€“ a child
                        can go to school regularly only when the family, particularly the mother is healthy and empowered; the child
                        gets proper nutrition; the family has decent livelihood opportunities and a steady income.

                        Realizing this, NEUB Foundation, beginning in the corridors of education, has adopted a lifecycle approach
                        which addresses the needs of children, their families and the larger community.</p>

                    <p>NEUB Foundation strongly believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the
                        process of development, sustainable change will not happen. Following this model of Civic Driven Change,
                        NEUB Foundation sensitizes and engages the civil society, making it an active partner in all its welfare
                        initiatives.</p>
